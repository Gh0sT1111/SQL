SQL Projects – Database Administration & Practice

This repository contains a collection of SQL scripts and exercises I developed while learning and practicing database administration and advanced SQL concepts. The projects are based on PostgreSQL and MySQL and include real-world inspired scenarios such as employee management, departments, salaries, and leave tracking.

Database Design – Tables with primary and foreign keys, relationships between entities.

Queries – Simple and advanced SELECT statements, JOINs, CTEs, subqueries, aggregate functions.

Analytical Functions – RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), PARTITION BY.

Views & Functions – Custom SQL views, user-defined functions, stored procedures.

Triggers – Automated actions for auditing changes and maintaining data integrity.

Indexes & Optimization – Using indexes and EXPLAIN ANALYZE to improve query performance.

Backup & Restore – Practicing database recovery and administration tasks.
